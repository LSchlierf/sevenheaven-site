This is the repository for the frontend for my band's website.

## Live version

This website is hosted through vercel, available at [sevenheaven.band](https://www.sevenheaven.band).

The webiste features seperate mobile and desktop layouts.

## Project structure

This website is build as a react app. The folder [src](src) contains the JavaScript code, split between [pages](src/Pages) for modules that actually represent a page on the website, and [components](src/Components) for modules that make up a part of a page.

The [public](public) folder contains the the [index.html](public/index.html) page, along with a [folder](public/img) containing all images as well as a [python script to generate all necessary sizes](public/img/sizes.py).
